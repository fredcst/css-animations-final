        <h2>About FedecaM<span class="copyright">©</span></h2> 
        <p>FedecaM is a tutorial website created by students for students. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-follow tutorial on the topic of scroll animation. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of scroll animation or an experienced learner seeking for inspiration, this website is tailored for you.</p>
        <p>FedecaM was largely inspired to follow the trend of Ultimate Simplification. Minimalistic, sleek, and presenting a tiny amount of text content. The idea behind ultra-minimalism is to create a sense of luxury, whilst focusing the user’s attention on what is truly required.</p>
        <p>Why Horizontal scrolling? Vertical scrolling is the navigational norm, and the user can be quite easily bored scrolling down an ultra-minimalistic website. FedecaM believes that breaking the norms to bring new to the user is a way to keep our users interested.</p>
        <p>This tutorial for horizontal scroll animation is designed to be easy to follow while still providing a lot of value. Walk through each step of the process and create more advanced transitions.</p>
